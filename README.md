# Week 11 Introduction to Unit Testing- Independent Project

# Telecommunication Billing Data Pipeline - Unit Testing
This project focuses on unit testing for a telecommunication billing data pipeline. The data pipeline is responsible for extracting data from a CSV file, performing transformations using pandas, and storing the transformed data in another CSV file. The goal is to develop robust unit tests for the functions in the data pipeline using the unittest framework.</p>

# Background Information
The Telecommunication Billing Data Pipeline project aims to process telecommunication billing data. The provided data pipeline consists of three main functions:

data_extraction: This function extracts data from a CSV file.</p>
data_transformation: This function performs transformations on the extracted data.</p>
data_loading: This function loads the transformed data into another CSV file.</p>

# Installation
To use the data pipeline and run the unit tests, follow these steps:</p>

# Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
Install the required dependencies. The main dependencies for this project are pandas and unittest. </p>
You can install them using pip: pip install pandas unittest</p>

# Usage
To run the data pipeline and execute the unit tests, execute the following command in the project directory:

<i><b>python unit_testing.py</i></b>

The data pipeline will read the billing data from a CSV file, perform the necessary transformations, and save the transformed data to another CSV file. The unit tests will be executed to ensure the correctness of the data pipeline functions.</p>

# Test Cases
The unit tests cover different scenarios and edge cases for each function in the data pipeline:

i. data_extraction</p>
Check if the returned object is a DataFrame.</p>
Check if the DataFrame has the expected columns.</p>
Check if the DataFrame has non-null values in all columns.</p>
Check if the DataFrame has at least one row.</p>

ii. data_transformation</p>

Check if the result of the transformation matches the expected transformed data.</p>

iii. data_loading </p>
Check if the saved data is a DataFrame.</p>
Check if the saved data has the same columns as the input data.</p>
Check if the saved data has the same values as the input data.</p>

The repository has the following structure:</p>
├── unit_testing.py        # Main script containing the data pipeline functions and unit tests </p>
├── billing_data.csv       # Sample input billing data in CSV format </p>
├── transformed_data.csv   # Example output file generated by the data pipeline </p>
└── README.md              # Project documentation (this file) </p>
